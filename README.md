# What Is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can
learn from data.

Here is a slightly more general definition:
  [Machine learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed.
—Arthur Samuel, 1959

And a more engineering-oriented one:
  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task
T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P,
improves with experience E.
—Tom Mitchell, 1997
