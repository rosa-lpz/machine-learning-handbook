It is common in predictive modeling to train a number of different models, apply each to a holdout sample, and assess their performance. Sometimes, after a number of models have been evaluated and tuned, and if there are enough data, a third holdout

Some terms for evaluation classification models:

* Accuracy
* Confusion matrix
* Sensitivity
* Specificity
* Precision
* ROC curve
* Lift
